# PhantomLite Project Progress

## Completed Features âœ…

### Core Engine
- âœ… Basic game loop (main.cpp)
- âœ… Asset pipeline for SVG-to-PNG conversion
- âœ… CMake build configuration

### Player Feature Slice
**Atoms:**
- âœ… Movement (position, speed, input handling)
- âœ… Animation (frame management, state transitions)
- âœ… Actions (attack, state management)
- âœ… Collision (shapes, detection, resolution)
- âœ… Debug visualization for collisions

**Molecules:**
- âœ… PlayerController (coordinates atoms)

**Organism:**
- âœ… Public API for the game engine

### World Feature Slice
**Atoms:**
- âœ… Tilemap (map structure, rendering, collision)
- âœ… Camera (following, bounds, screen transformations)

**Organisms:**
- âœ… World API (public interface for other slices)

### Art Assets
- âœ… SVG character design
- âœ… Basic animations (idle, walk, attack)
- âœ… Environment tiles (grass, dirt, water)
- âœ… Obstacle objects (trees, bushes)
- âœ… Asset conversion pipeline with transparency support

## Architecture Checklist

### Atom Standards
- âœ… Files â‰¤ 150 LOC
- âœ… Single responsibility
- âœ… Pure functional interfaces where possible
- âœ… Encapsulated in appropriate namespaces

### Molecule Standards
- âœ… Composed of atoms only
- âœ… Clear internal state management
- âœ… Well-defined interfaces

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for atoms
- [ ] Integration tests for molecules
- [ ] System tests for the full game

## Performance Metrics
- ðŸ”„ CPU frame time: Target â‰¤ 2ms (needs measurement)
- ðŸ”„ Draw calls: Target â‰¤ 250 (needs measurement)
- ðŸ”„ Memory usage: Target â‰¤ 64MB (needs measurement)

## Next Steps Priority

1. Expand world with different biomes
   - Create more tile variations
   - Design transition areas between biomes
   - Implement more decorative elements

2. Implement vertical movement
   - Add jumping mechanics
   - Create proper animation transitions
   - Update collision handling for vertical movement

3. Add simple enemies
   - Implement basic AI
   - Create enemy sprites
   - Set up combat interactions
